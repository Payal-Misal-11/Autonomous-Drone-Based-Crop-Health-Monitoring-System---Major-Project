Autonomous Drone-Based Crop Health Monitoring System Using Deep Learning
📌 Project Overview

The Autonomous Drone-Based Crop Health Monitoring System is an intelligent precision agriculture solution designed to monitor crop health efficiently using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning techniques. The system autonomously surveys agricultural fields, captures high-resolution images of crops, and analyzes them using deep learning models to detect plant stress, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies at an early stage.

This approach helps farmers reduce manual inspection efforts, optimize resource usage, and improve crop yield through timely and data-driven decision-making.
