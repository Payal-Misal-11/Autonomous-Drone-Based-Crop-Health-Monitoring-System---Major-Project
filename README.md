# Autonomous Drone-Based Crop Health Monitoring System Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Description
The **Autonomous Drone-Based Crop Health Monitoring System** is a smart agriculture solution that utilizes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning techniques to monitor crop health efficiently. The drone autonomously captures aerial images of agricultural fields, which are then analyzed using deep learning models to detect crop diseases, stress, and nutrient deficiencies.

This system helps farmers make timely decisions, reduce manual labor, and improve crop productivity through precision agriculture.
